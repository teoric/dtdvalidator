= DTD-based XML Validator

== Purpose

For some big files, `xmllint` fails or takes a long time.
A validating parse with Java's libraries does more or less the same checks.

== Build and use

Build is configured to need Java 11.  May be possible to tweak `pom.xml` to compile on Java 8.

[source, shell]
mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies
java -jar .\target\i5validator-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -h
